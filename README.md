# Marine-Oil-Spill-Detection-with-Low-quality-SAR-Remote-Sensing-Images

Thank you all for your attention to this project.

Due to the project team's inability to obtain original SAR images with copyright permission, the progress of correcting the SOS dataset has been suspended. The SOS dataset can be downloaded from the following URL.

The project team has performed pixel-level annotations on a considerable number of images in the SOS dataset. However, many images are too blurry to be annotated manually. If anyone considers the quality of such a dataset acceptable, please email me, and the project team can make it publicly available.
